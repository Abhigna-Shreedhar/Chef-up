# Chef-up
This repo is my submission for Udacity's UX Designer Nanodegree. It involved learning how to create a digital user experience that is ready to be handed off for development. I started by building familiarity and fluency with design research fundamentals to identify the user and the solutions they need, after which I synthesized my research, and used design sprints to take an idea from concept to low-fidelity prototype. Finally, I learnt how to turn my low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity design, and improve its performance based on data. 
This is a compilation of complete projects that can be incorporated into a UX portfolio at the end of the program in order to showcase your capabilities to future employers.
